World of Essence Website

 This has been designed to be a simple, clean and professional (and initially) static website. Easy to navigate , appealing, engaging and responsive.
 The aim is to eventually provide an ecommerce platform for the sale of products currently highlighted.

UX

Primarily this website is designed for the convenience of customers and potential customers to view, compare and (eventually) purchase from a range of products.
The future considerations are for a simplified, non technical way for offers to be added to the website, images to be added/removed as the range expands or changes.
by the owner.W

The original concept was for:
1. Simple navigation bar incorparating the company logo, light appealing colours and intuitive navigation aids to successive pages. The logo 
is also a "home button"
2. landing page, visually introducing the customer to the range of products by means of a carousel.
3. About page to give an idea of the ethos of the company. Simple and assuring text , a further option to move straight to the products via a simple button.
4. A products page to display the items with a brief description.

I believe that the result is visually appealing, professional looking and responsive. Whilst there are improvements to be made this is a perfect example of what can be achieved using HTML5,css,Bootstrap and 
some javascript.

I heve tested the website as responsive on all media types and am reasonably convinced as to it's effectiveness. There may be some snall visual anomalies which will need to be ironed out.
All navigational links have been seen to be working.
